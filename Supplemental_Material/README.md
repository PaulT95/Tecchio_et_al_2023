Fascicle length adaptations following eccentric exercise of lower limb in vivo human muscles reported in the literature. The numbers next to the black dots represent the reference number of the study.

Tibialis anterior moment arm values measured from three studies and estimated in OpenSim at four ankle joint angles relevant for this study (-15° dorsiflexion, 0°, 15° and 30° plantarflexion) at rest (2 studies) and during maximal voluntary contraction (1 study). The dashed lines represent second-order polynomial fits that were extrapolated to +35° plantarflexion.

Individual (n = 12) crank arm angle values at the dorsiflexed position (-5°, DF) and plantarflexed position (+35°, PF) across the different contraction conditions, along with the mean angular velocity (ω) during the three MTU-stretch-hold conditions.

Tibialis anterior superficial compartment fascicle angle variations from rest to maximal voluntary contraction over a 40° range of motion across 12 participants. The gray dots represent single values of the participants’ minimum and maximum values during the conditions, and the black horizontal line represents the mean. Mean = 12.4°, range = 5.6° - 22.8°.
