## Study setup figure
Participants were seated with the backrest seat tilted at ~70° (20° from the vertical), the thigh supported by an external support, 
and the foot secured to the dynamometer footplate attachment. 
A 3D custom-printed device was tightly fixed over the proximal metatarsal joints to prevent torque contributions from the toe extensors during voluntary dorsiflexion contractions. 
The neutral position was defined as a perpendicular angle between the sole of the footplate and the tibia. 
The two electrodes for the bipolar surface electromyography (EMG) recordings and the more proximal ultrasound transducer, 
which was fixed with an elastic bandage over the tibialis anterior mid-muscle belly, are depicted in red.
